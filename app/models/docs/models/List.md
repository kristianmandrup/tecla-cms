List
====

A List is used to contain lists of items. A list can be a composite list, ie. a List can be an item in another list. Lists should be embedded, not referenced (for performance reasons).

A List is primarily designed to be used to model Menus, Nested menus, tabs etc. for use in an app. List items should have a label and optionally a link and an icon. List items should be localizable.
