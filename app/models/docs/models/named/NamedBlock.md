Named Block
===========

A Named block is a key/value construct, where the value is a `block`. This allows the block to be composed in one or more components using any name in that context (default key is own name).

### Concerns

Inherits from `Cms::Named::Composite` which grants a `name` and makes it a composite.

### Relations

`has_one :block`

### Fields

NONE
