Named Image
===========

A Named image is a key/value construct, where the value is an `image`. This allows the image to be composed in one or more components using any name in that context (default key is own name).

### Concerns

Inherits from `Cms::Named::Composite` which grants a `name` and makes it a composite.

### Relations

`has_one :image`

### Fields
